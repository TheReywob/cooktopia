# Cooktopia
Cooktopia is a virtual cookbook where users can upload their own recipes to the web to access them whenever and wherever they please. Users who utilize Cooktopia will never have to rely on physical recipe cards that are susceptible to wear and tear or being lost and forgotten. Cooktopia offers the ability for users to discover and save new recipes that others have uploaded, in order to expand their own cookbook.

Cooktopia was made in a college course where the goal is to create an application by collaborating with a group of class members using the scrum method. The project team members are:
